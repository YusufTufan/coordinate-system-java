## 🧩 Features

* **Point Management:** Define points with (x, y) coordinates.
* **Line Segments:** Create lines connecting two points and calculate distances.
* **PolyLine Support:** Handle connected series of line segments.
* **Geometric Operations:** Calculate lengths, distances, and midpoints.
* **OOP Design:** Utilizes composition and encapsulation efficiently.
